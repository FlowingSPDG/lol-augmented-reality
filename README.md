# League of Legends Augumented Reality
## LoL Augumented Reality(Proof-of-Concept. WIP)

### What's this?
LoL's AR softwere by using replay-API.  
The softwere requests camera pos to LoL client,and apply those pos to Unity.  
The AR itself is impalamented with greenback,so you probably need to use chroma-key.
